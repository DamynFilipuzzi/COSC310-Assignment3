# COSC310-Assignment3-Damyn_Filipuzzi


The purpose of the program we created is to assist users in solving their technology problems. This chatbot is similar to ones you would see on websites such as TELUS where the chatbot leads the user through a series of questions in order to attempt to solve the users tech problems. In order to run the program in eclipse you will need to complete the following steps:


1.	Download and install Eclipse.
2.	In your browser, open the URL for the github repository , click accept, click the URL then click Clone and copy the URL
3.	In Eclipse, File - import - git - projects from Git - clone URI then enter the URI.


To run the chatbot you will need to run the class "Interface.java" located in the Gui package as a java application.
